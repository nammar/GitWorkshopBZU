# GitWorkshopBZU
In this workshop we will learn basic git commands both through the GUI provided by the GithubDesktop and the command line.

# common mistakes
People misuse github
unlike google drive, github is used for source version control and team work
avoid committing zip files of projects commit .java files instead
commit without synching 
publishing does not mean synching
commiting does not mean pushing
do not check in bin directory, .classpath, .project, system specific files

# command line
git init: initialize an existing directory as a Git repository

git status (working directory vs. remote (master branch))
