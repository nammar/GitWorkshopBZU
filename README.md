# GitWorkshopBZU
In this workshop we will learn basic git commands both through the GUI provided by the GithubDesktop and the command line.

# common mistakes
1. People misuse github by treating it as Google drive for example. Unlike google drive, github is used for source version control and team work. Thus, avoid committing zip files of projects, commit .java files instead.
2. People should synch before committing 
3. do not commit binary files (e.g., .class files in bin directory in Elipse), .classpath, .project, system specific files and libraries (e.g. JDK)
